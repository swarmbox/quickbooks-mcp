# Entity Coverage

What the read tools can and cannot see, and why. Derived from the [Intuit
all-entities reference](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/accounting/all-entities/account)
and from `node_modules/node-quickbooks/index.js` as of v2.0.46.

## Three layers of coverage

A read tool can only surface a posting if **all three** hold:

1. **The entity is queryable** — QBO exposes it at `/query`.
2. **We can reach it** — either node-quickbooks wraps it, or we go through
   `src/client/rest.ts`.
3. **The account is explicit in the entity JSON** — there is an `*AccountRef`
   to match against. This is the layer that cannot be fixed in our code.

## Layer 2: entities node-quickbooks does not wrap

node-quickbooks declares one prototype method per entity and keeps its generic
CRUD helpers on the CommonJS `module` object rather than `module.exports`, so
omitted entities are unreachable through the client object. Six queryable
entities fall in that gap:

| Entity | Notes |
|---|---|
| CreditCardPayment | Posting. Reached via raw REST; covered by `query` and `query_account_transactions`. |
| TaxPayment | Posting. Reachable via `query`; not in the account drill-down (line shape unverified). |
| InventoryAdjustment | Posting. Same as above. |
| ReimburseCharge | Billable-expense link. Reachable via `query`. |
| RecurringTransaction | A template, not a posting transaction. |
| TaxClassification | Reference data. |

`src/query/pagination.ts` resolves this automatically: `fetcherForEntity()` uses
the wrapper method when one exists and raw REST otherwise, so `query` reaches
every queryable entity without an allow-list to maintain.

### The CreditCardPayment naming trap

Three different spellings for one entity — worth knowing before adding write
support:

| Context | Spelling |
|---|---|
| REST path | `/v3/company/<realmID>/creditcardpayment` |
| Query statement | `select * from creditcardpayment` |
| **JSON wrapper key (request and response)** | **`CreditCardPaymentTxn`** |

Pagination discovers the response key dynamically (first array-valued key in
`QueryResponse`), so this costs nothing on the read path. Any future
create/update handler must send and unwrap `CreditCardPaymentTxn`.

## Layer 3: postings with no account reference — structurally invisible

These cannot be recovered from entity JSON at any amount of effort, because QBO
never puts the account in the payload:

| Posting | Why it is invisible |
|---|---|
| A/R side of Invoice | **Invoice has no `ARAccountRef`.** Confirmed against the entity reference. |
| A/R side of CreditMemo | Same — no `ARAccountRef`. |
| A/R side of Payment | Same. Only `DepositToAccountRef` is exposed. |
| Sales tax liability | Posts through `TxnTaxDetail`, which carries `TaxRateRef`, not an `AccountRef`. |
| Item-driven COGS / inventory | Derived from the Item's configured accounts, not stated on the line. |

Consequence: **`query_account_transactions` can never be complete on an A/R or
sales-tax-liability account.** **A/P is only half fine.** `APAccountRef` is
explicit on Bill and VendorCredit — the credit side — but **BillPayment does not
carry it at all**, so the debit side of every bill payment is invisible. Measured
on a live company over one month: A/P credits matched the general ledger to the
cent, while 97.7% of A/P debits were missing.

The tool now says so in its output. It used to name only Accounts Receivable —
this document claimed Other Current Liability too, but no such branch existed —
and naming account types at all only ever covered the gaps somebody had already
found. Every call is now cross-checked against the General Ledger for the same
account and period, and reports a shortfall in the figures whatever its cause.
That is what surfaced the BillPayment gap above. For a complete figure on those accounts, use `account_period_summary`,
which reads the General Ledger report. Reports show every posting regardless of
whether the account appears in the entity JSON — a GL-report-backed drill-down
is the correct long-term fix for this whole class of gap.

`get_report` widens that escape hatch: 24 further QBO reports, the general
ledger and journal among them. For the A/R question specifically —
what is outstanding, and how old is it — `aged_receivables` and
`aged_receivable_detail` answer directly what no entity query can reach, and
`customer_balance_detail` breaks it down by customer. The A/P equivalents are
there too, even though A/P is reachable by entity, because the report already
does the aging arithmetic.

## Posting entities in `query_account_transactions`

| Entity | Scanned | Sides extracted |
|---|:--:|---|
| JournalEntry | ✅ | every line, signed by `PostingType` |
| Purchase | ✅ | header `AccountRef` (credit) + `AccountBasedExpenseLineDetail` (debit) |
| Deposit | ✅ | header `DepositToAccountRef` (debit) + `DepositLineDetail` (credit) |
| SalesReceipt | ✅ | header `DepositToAccountRef` (debit) + `ItemAccountRef` (credit) |
| Bill | ✅ | header `APAccountRef` (credit) + expense lines (debit) |
| Invoice | ✅ | `DepositToAccountRef`/`Deposit` (debit) + income lines (credit). A/R invisible. |
| Payment | ✅ | header `DepositToAccountRef` (debit). A/R invisible. |
| BillPayment | ⚠️ | `CheckPayment.BankAccountRef` or `CreditCardPayment.CCAccountRef` (credit) only. **No `APAccountRef` in the payload** — the A/P debit is invisible. |
| VendorCredit | ✅ | `APAccountRef` (debit) + expense lines (credit) |
| Transfer | ✅ | `ToAccountRef` (debit) + `FromAccountRef` (credit) |
| CreditMemo | ✅ | income lines (debit). A/R invisible. |
| RefundReceipt | ✅ | `DepositToAccountRef` (credit) + income lines (debit) |
| CreditCardPayment | ✅ | `CreditCardAccountRef` (debit) + `BankAccountRef` (credit) |
| TaxPayment | ❌ | posting, line shape unverified |
| InventoryAdjustment | ❌ | posting, line shape unverified |
| Estimate, PurchaseOrder, TimeActivity | ❌ | non-posting by design |
| RecurringTransaction | ❌ | template, not a transaction |

Every call reports `coverage.scannedEntityTypes` in its report data (stdio only —
it is static, and inline in HTTP it would be pure context cost), and warns in the
summary when an individual entity query failed, so an incomplete drill-down is
never presented as a complete one.

### Parent accounts: the drill-down and the reports count differently

This is the single most confusing disagreement between the two account tools,
and it is the data model rather than a bug:

| Tool | Backed by | Counts sub-accounts? |
|---|---|---|
| `account_period_summary` | General Ledger report | **Always** — rolled into the parent |
| `query_account_transactions` | Entity reads matching `AccountRef` | Only with `include_subaccounts: true` |

A parent account that holds no postings of its own — common when a card or loan
is tracked through named sub-accounts — reports plenty of activity in
`account_period_summary` and **zero** in the drill-down. Nothing is missing; the
postings name the sub-account, and an entity read matches one `AccountRef`.

`include_subaccounts` defaults to `false` so existing callers keep their current
results. When the resolved account has children and they were not included, the
summary says so and names them, so the discrepancy explains itself rather than
looking like missing data.

Sub-accounts are collected with `collectAccountTree`, which walks `ParentRef`
transitively — QBO nests up to five levels, so checking one level down is not
enough — and tolerates a cyclic `ParentRef` without hanging.

### Throttling is a third way a result can look short

Intuit throttles per realm. The drill-down queries 13 entity types and each one
auto-paginates, so firing them all at once reliably trips the limit — and a
throttled entity comes back empty, which reads as "no activity on this account"
rather than "ask again". Two guards:

- Entity queries run at `ENTITY_QUERY_CONCURRENCY` (4) at a time rather than all
  at once.
- `fetcherForEntity` wraps every page fetch in `withRetry`, which backs off with
  jitter on 429/5xx and network errors. Validation faults (4xxx) and auth faults
  (3xxx) are **not** retried — a malformed query fails identically every time,
  and retrying it burns throttle budget the other queries need.

If an entity still fails after retries, the summary names it explicitly. Treat
that warning as "this result is incomplete", not as a cosmetic note.

### Completeness vs. the returned window

Two different things can make a result look short, and they should not be
confused:

| | Meaning | How to get the rest |
|---|---|---|
| **Pagination** | The period has more transactions than this window returned. | Call again with the reported `offset`. Totals in `summary` already cover the full period. |
| **Coverage** | The posting exists but carries no account reference (A/R, sales tax) or its entity type is not scanned. | Not retrievable here at all — use `account_period_summary`. |

`summary.totalDebits` / `totalCredits` / `netChange` and `transactionCount` are
always computed over the **full** result set, never the returned window, so they
do not shift as a caller pages. Only `transactions` and `groupedByTransaction`
are windowed.

The window defaults to the full result set in stdio (detail goes to a temp file,
so it is free) and to `HTTP_DEFAULT_LIMIT` transactions in HTTP mode (detail goes
inline into the model's context). Both honor an explicit `limit`.

### Refunds flip the sign

`Purchase.Credit === true` marks a refund or return rather than a charge. Both
sides invert: the bank or card is **debited** and the expense account credited.
QBO's own reports honor this, so an extractor that ignores it counts a refund as
a second charge and the account cannot tie out to the General Ledger.

Only `Purchase` carries this flag. Refunds on the sales side are their own
entity (`RefundReceipt`), already signed correctly.

### Known partial extractions

Real gaps within entities that *are* scanned:

- **`ItemBasedExpenseLineDetail` is ignored** on Purchase and Bill — only
  `AccountBasedExpenseLineDetail` lines are read. Item-based expense lines are
  invisible.
- **SalesReceipt / Invoice / CreditMemo / RefundReceipt lines without an explicit
  `ItemAccountRef` are skipped**, since the income account is then implied by the
  Item.

## QBO app links

`src/utils/urls.ts` maps entity → QBO app route. The routes are not derivable
from entity names (`journalentry` → `journal`, `purchase` → `expense`), so a
mapping is only added once confirmed against a real transaction. Unmapped
entities return `null` and callers omit the link rather than emit a guessed 404.

Confirmed: journalentry, purchase, deposit, salesreceipt, bill, billpayment,
invoice, payment, customer.

Not yet confirmed (no link emitted): vendorcredit, transfer, creditmemo,
refundreceipt, creditcardpayment.
